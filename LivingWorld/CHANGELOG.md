# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

Player-facing version **1.0.0** (`About.xml` `modVersion`). Startup writes `[LivingWorld] v1.0.0 loaded from ...` in Player.log.

### Changed
- **Workshop preview** (`preview-redraw-v2`) — `About/Preview.png` (and docs hero) is a flat world-map card: hard hill polygons, settlement blocks, geometric caravan. Under Steam's 1 MB cap.

### Added

- **Unlisted docs page** — `docs/living-world.html` with `noindex` (not linked from the public hub).
- **Languages README** — translator stub for Keyed packs (`repo-hygiene-1-6`).
- **Listening Post scenario** — off-map world showcase start; locks Azrael when Homesteader is loaded.
- **Phase 2 — Wars and fallout** (`living-world-phase2`) — NPC faction diplomacy and player-facing fallout.
  - `FactionPairState` Peace / Tension / War / Alliance; skirmish, battle, white peace, rare pact/betrayal write the chronicle and nudge settlement prosperity.
  - Concurrent war cap, war-rate slider, Mod Options for diplomacy / fallout / trade blackout / war sites / warbands (warbands default off).
  - Refugee incident after severe visible wars; optional pass-through warband (points-capped).
  - Short-lived generic war sites on the world map (tile-avoid vs Nemesis by name).
  - Trade blackout soft-blocks trader caravans for factions in total war.
  - Dev tools: dump pairs, force diplomacy / war / battle / refugees.
- **Phase 1 foundation** (`living-world-phase1`) — off-map chronicle + settlement morph.
  - Slow sim pulse with Mod Options (interval, verbosity, letter/morph caps, proximity).
  - Hear-rules: major always; medium = contact / nearby / allies; high adds comms + more noise.
  - Morphs: prosperity drift, ownership flip, abandon, outpost, epithet; inspector / label cues.
  - `LivingWorldSignals` soft bus for Deep Colony / Nemesis / Homesteader (no hard deps yet).
  - Dev tools: dump chronicle, force morph kinds, fake skirmish letter.
